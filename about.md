## About

I spent a decade as an educator blissfully unaware that one of the major aspects that I loved about my job was an entire career unto itself. When the time came to transition into a new career, I realized I already had 10 years of data analysis experience under my belt and smoothly traversed the path to a new career.  

Versatile, quality-oriented professional with a unique intersection of technical and interpersonal skillsets. Self-motivated with a passion for uncovering growth potential, creating strategies and solutions that support big-picture goals and promote data-driven decisions.  A bold, creative thinker capitalizing on years of experience presenting complex ideas as easy to understand concepts to vastly different stakeholders.
