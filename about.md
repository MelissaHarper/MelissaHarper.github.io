## About

I spent a decade as an educator blissfully unaware that one of my favorite aspects of my job, data analysis, was an entire career unto itself. When the time came to transition into a new career, I realized I already had 10 years of data analysis under my belt and smoothly traversed the path to a new career.  

## Summary Statement

Self-motivated with a passion for uncovering growth potential, creating strategies and solutions that support big-picture goals and promote data-driven decisions.
